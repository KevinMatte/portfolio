# Portfolio Project 
**(Inactive for 6 years. Working for Shaw/Rogers)**

This Web Site hosts my Portfolio.

I've just really started Feb 5th, 2019 and going fast, just to get a full stack app react running
before my next career move.

* Inactive: Web Site: [http://24.64.174.212/](http://24.64.174.212/)

* GitHub: [https://github.com/KevinMatte/portfolio](https://github.com/KevinMatte/portfolio)

**Note**: It is WIP and actively updated.

The Portfolio contains:
* full stack development with:

  * MySql _(Future)_
  * Apache2
  * WSGI
  * Python 3
  * Flask
  * ReactJS
  * Material-UI
  * HTML5
  * Kubernetes (with Docker for containers) _(Future)_

* Linux (Ubuntu) administration & networking


As EOD February 6, 2019, it currently demonstrates the full stack, but with very little ReactJS, and isn’t yet using Kubernetes. It just shows a ‘Hello World’ button.

In the future, I’ll also be adding AngularJS, EmberJS and hosting it in Amazon Web Services, all of which I’ve done before, but not for myself or a portfolio.

Having fun while I wait for my next career move!


# Text Pages

* The front page uses HTML5 with flex (css/styles.css) and iFrame.

* HTML pages handle their own loayouts and customized colouring in a `style` element.

* This README.md markdown pages will be converted to HTML for viewing
in the Portfolio pages.

    * Using https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown to convert Markdown to HTML.
    * Using https://github.com/janl/mustache.js to wrap HTML with Body element and include styles.
    * Using NodeJS. See showdown.js to see how its done.

* More complex text pages, such as my resume, will be exported from LibreWriter
as HTML. It's not perfect, but it gets me to the end faster.
