      <B>Kevin Matte Software Designs</B> is a family run business
      that incorporated in 2003.

      Currently, the main Systems Business Analyst is Kevin Matte
      (myself). I have a BSc from the University of British Columbia
      with a major in Mathematical Computing.

      I started my career in software development back in 1987 as a
      software contractor working on a school scheduling system for
      students. I moved on to a telephone operator scheduling system
      and then an aircraft heavy maintenance scheduling system.

      Later, I started a career in telecommunication software at
      Microtel Pacific Research (Burnaby, Canada), which was bought by
      Applied Digital Access (San Diego: where I was happily
      transferred), which was bought by TTC, which became Acterna,
      which was bought by JDS Uniphase.

      I wore many hats, project manager, project prime, ISO 9000
      auditor, team leader, mentor senior software developer, and
      several titles as company changes and reorganizations occurred
      and worked with many languages and UNIX/Microsoft platforms (but
      not Windows .NET).

    </P>

      I work well in a team or alone (very alone, remotely and the
      only one left on a project, I might add). I really enjoy my
      work, the people and all the challenges and rewards.
